# Soul-Stealing-Mod

**New System - Soulstealing**

  - You now have a choice between butcher/bury and soulstealing defeated creatures.
  - Soulstealing works by using a sacrificial knife on a corpse and selecting "Soulsteal" - this will perform an action much like butchering.
  - After the soulsteal, the corpse is removed completely, meaning no need to bury. Butchered corpses cannot have their souls stolen.
  - If successful, the soulsteal will give you the soul of the creature. This is a lightweight object that can be stored relatively conveniently.
  - This makes soulstealing an "on-the-go" alternative to butchering. Stealing souls does not create high-weight objects out of corpses to lug around, as well as cleaning the corpse in a single action.
  - Your ability to obtain a soul, as well as the quality of the soul, is based on your Stealing skill and the combat rating of the creature. Higher combat rating creatures will have souls more easily stolen.

**New Item: Eternal Reservoir**

- The eternal reservoir is created using the Pottery skill. Start with a star diamond and pile of dirt, then add the following resources:
1. 99 dirt
2. 200 pottery bricks
3. 50 peat
4. 50 zinc lump
5. 50 chaos crystals
6. 20 hearts
7. 5 sapphires, rubies, emeralds, opals, and diamonds

- Once created, you can activate souls and feed them to the device. There is currently an action to give you a rough idea of how much "soul power" the device has.
- When fueled, the eternal reservoir automatically feeds nearby branded carnivores. This means you will not need to place meat underneath the creatures, and instead just feed the device souls.
- Furthermore, the device will also use the souls to keep nearby forges and ovens lit.
- The range of the device is QL/10 in each direction. For reference, that means a 50QL eternal reservoir will go 5 tiles in each direction from the tile it's on, ending up being an 11x11 coverage area. This gives a maximum potential coverage area of 19x19 at 90ql+.
- Souls are a "fuel" for the eternal reservoir, and get consumed when used to supply nearby creatures with food or fires with fuel. A steady stream of souls is required to keep them functional.
- Soul Strength skill assists in adding additional power to the eternal reservoir when feeding souls.
- The reservoir only functions with objects above ground if it's above ground, and only in a cave if it's in a cave. A single reservoir will not function for both underground and above ground purposes.
